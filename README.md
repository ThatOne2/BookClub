A small project to understand how to code

Start:

- dotnet run
- debug mode f5 
- no debug mode ctrl + f5 (I see theres a difference but idk)

When you dotnet run it just chooses the first one, so I had to re-order profiels and http in the /Properties/launchSettings.json.
Could also just have written specifically which one to run, e.g. ```dotnet run --launch-profile http```
